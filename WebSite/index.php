    <h1>Whippy Term Preview</h1>
    <p>
        Whippy Term is now available to a limited number of people by private invite.
    </p>
    <p>
        This is an <span style="font-size:1.5em;color:#C51E3A">ALPHA</span> build.  There's a lot <i>wrong</i>, and a lot <i>missing</i>.
        However it's starting to become useful in some contexts so I have started letting people play with it.
    </p>
    <p>
        I will be making release builds ever now and then so check back every now and then.
    </p>
