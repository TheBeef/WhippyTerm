 * NAME:
 *    TCPClient_AllocateHandle
 *
 * SYNOPSIS:
 *    t_DriverIOHandleType *TCPClient_AllocateHandle(const char *DeviceUniqueID,
 *          t_IOSystemHandle *IOHandle);
 *
 * PARAMETERS:
 *    DeviceUniqueID [I] -- This is the unique ID for the device we are working
 *                          on.
 *    IOHandle [I] -- A handle to the IO system.  This is used when talking
 *                    the IO system (just store it and pass it went needed).
 *
 * FUNCTION:
 *    This function allocates a connection to the device.
 *
 *    The system uses two different objects to talk in/out of a device driver.
 *
 *    The first is the Detect Device ID.  This is used to assign a value to
 *    all the devices detected on the system.  This is just a number (that
 *    is big enough to store a pointer).  The might be the comport number
 *    (COM1 and COM2 might be 1,2) or a pointer to a string with the
 *    path to the OS device driver (or really anything the device driver wants
 *    to use).
 *    This is used by the system to know what device out of all the available
 *    devices it is talk about.
 *    These may be allocated when the system wants a list of devices, or it
 *    may not be allocated at all.
 *
 *    The second is the t_DriverIOHandleType.  This is a handle is allocated
 *    when the user opens a new connection (new tab).  It contains any needed
 *    data for a connection.  This is not the same as opening the connection
 *    (which actually opens the device with the OS).
 *    This may include things like allocating buffers, a place to store the
 *    handle returned when the driver actually opens the device with the OS
 *    and anything else the driver needs.
 *
 * RETURNS:
 *    Newly allocated data for this connection or NULL on error.
 *
 * SEE ALSO:
 *    ConvertConnectionUniqueID2DriverID(), DetectNextConnection(),
 *    FreeHandle()
